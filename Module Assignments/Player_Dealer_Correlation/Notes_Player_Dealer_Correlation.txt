Summary of Findings
I belive the the Dealer Billy Jones and the Player Mylie Schmidt were colluding with each other

Myle Schmidt had played for a total of 19 times and out of those 19 times, 13 were losses.
Billy Jones was the only dealer that was there for all the large losses and he was on the same table as Myle Schmidt in
13 losses that occured.
